	I was fortunate enough to get the importance of configuration managment drilled into me early on when I started to learn programming. Although our configuration managment was rudimentary, it was effective when we were updating or fixing bugs on large projects
	
	
	To our discredit however, our version managment was quite awful when I look back at it now. While I used to work for Oceanic there were only two of us who worked on all the programming projects for our department. We could afford to be a little bit lax with our versioning. By "a little bit lax" however, I mean that our version numbers were actually dates. We'd have a project named something like 20050607_project and many professional and even hobbyist programmers would burn us at the stake for this.
