##How JavaScript Found Me
It's probably been about six or seven years since I last wrote in Javascript regularly. Earlier in my life I worked for Oceanic Time Warner cable where I worked as a software engineer for them. My job was to program and build all of their interactive TV channels and all of them were written in a combination of HTML and JavaScript.

I wasn't always familiar with JavaScript of course. When I first started at Oceanic I was a complete greenhorn and completely out of my depth. Through a lucky break and knowing the right people I landed an internship opportunity right out of high school at not even eighteen years old. In high school I took a few A+ courses and bumbled my way through basic hardware and networking classes so when I signed on to Oceanic I explained my background was mostly limited to an L1 IT. The department I was assigned to in the machine was effectively brand new and already had a primary IT leaving me in a weird purgatory of on staff but superfluous. Instead, on my first day on the job after the initial interview, my supervisor asked me to see him and gave me the talk that effetively started me down my computer science path. They didn't need an IT. What they did need however was a programmer. Because the market saturation for Oceanic in Hawaii is so high compared to other states, Oceanic was used as a testbed for many new and cutting-edge cable TV services. One of these new services were interative channels. On-demand TV that you could control seemed pretty cool however they had only one other person building and developing their whole interative channel network. This was the day I was given a JavaScript reference book and flatly told "learn this".
