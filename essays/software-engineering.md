## Starting Out

I wasn't always interested in programming. During high school I loved computers but it was mostly limited to the understading the hardware aspect. I wanted to know what all the different components inside did, and I wanted to tinker with it. I knew of programming as a distant and super difficult discipline for only the most hardcore and dedicated. It wasn't until I got an internship at Oceanic Time Warner Cable that I first discovered programming for what it really was: a tool to do anything and everything you could ever imagine.

My initial draw towards programming was for game development. I was a naive high school student who didn't know better. Once I started learning JavaScript on the job I dreamt of what I could do with it. I imagined making a grid based RPG that I could actually publish to our TV networks and even started working on a prototype in my free time. I was worfully underprepared for that type of endeavor however and it was the realization that I had so much more to learn but didn't know where to begin that eventually led me to quit and return to school. These days my software development interestes are bit more diverse and reasonable. While I still enjoy the occasional game style project I like to do many more practical projects. For instance some of the things I've worked on in the past were small programs that stepped through different algorithms to show how they work. It made it much easier to follow along and understand how it worked than trying to keep track in my head. I've also built a web form for Kawaii Kon that tracks all of our staff members in an Oracle database and makes it easy for us to track stats for all of our staff.

In the future I'd like to develop skills pertaining to larger scale projects. While I was working at Oceanic I did collaborative work on projects that had maybe two or three thousand lines of code at most and some even were as little as several hundred. I'd love to work on developing programs that spand tens of thousands of lines of code. The collaboration aspect is something that I haven't had much experience with in the past.
