## Road Blocs

We've all been there at one point. We're working on a project and getting into the groove of things. You're adding feature after feature and bam, two more things off the checklist. You move on to the next one expecting to knock it out like it's predecessors when suddenly errors everywhere. You look at the errors - *"Oh, simple!"* - you think to yourself. You just mistyped a variable. You quickly fix it and then boom -- another error. This time though it's much more cryptic. As programmers we would love to give verbose and meaningful error codes and descriptions but realistically we can't cover everything. You go back, check your code. Make sure every variable is typed correctly, you have semicolons everywhere, and you closed all your brackets, parenthesis, curly braces, and other curvy lines. 

> *"It should work!"* - Every Programmer Ever

You run it again one more time in futility and question where it all went wrong. You stare at it, Google it, and after several unsuccesful suggestions you decide to take things into your own hands and ask the question yourself.

## There Are No Stupid Questions

This statement was drilled into every student's heads when I grew up going to school in Hawaii. I'm sure a similar sentiment has been expressed elsewhere and they all mean the same thing. You should always ask a question no matter how simple or trivial it is. You might not be the only one who needs clarification! Perhaps by asking your question you can help someone else too. Even if not, it's better to ask than fall behind right? In a school setting, sure, this is a great mentality. You're all there to learn and the lecturer or teacher is expected to be reasonably knowledgeable on the subject enough to answer your questions. Discussion can lead to clarification if your question is lacking, and the subject can be expanded upon if it's relevant. 

There are no stupid questions.

Actually, yes, there are stupid questions. Semantics aside, once you start looking for expertise online on forums, newsgroups, developer networks, and other such locations how you ask your question is just as or even more impotant than the question itself. You are but one of thousands of developers asking all sorts of questions at the same time. How do you make sure yours is the people with the knowledge read yours and take the time to answer? It's simple -- you ask a smart question.

According Eric Raymond, your question should follow several guidelines such as:

> Use meaningful, specific subject headers

> Make it easy to reply

> Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language

> Send questions in accessible, standard formats

> Be precise and informative about your problem

> Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses

While these are not all of the guidelines that were listed, they can be generally summarized into three categories:
  * Ask your question in a precise and meaningful way.
  * List symptoms verbosely and do not interject your own conclusions.
  * Be courteous and mindful of the people replying to you.
