## Road Blocs

We've all been there at one point. We're working on a project and getting into the groove of things. You're adding feature after feature and bam, two more things off the checklist. You move on to the next one expecting to knock it out like it's predecessors when suddenly errors everywhere. You look at the errors - "oh, simple" you think to yourself. You just mistyped a variable. You quickly fix it and then boom -- another error. This time though it's much more cryptic. As programmers we would love to give verbose and meaningful error codes and descriptions but realistically we can't cover everything. You go back, check your code. Make sure every variable is typed correctly, you have semicolons everywhere, and you closed all your brackets, parenthesis, curly braces, and other curvy lines.
