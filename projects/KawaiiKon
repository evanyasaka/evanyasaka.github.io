## Kawaii Kon
Kawaii Kon is Hawaii's largest and longest running anime convention dedicated to the celebration of Japanese animated shows(anime), comics(manga), and the culture and community that surround it. Held yearly in the Spring, Kawaii Kon brings industry guests, musical talent, vendors, local artists, and community icons under one roof. We are a not-for-profit organization with a set of core directors and organizers within Hawaii who present a 3-day celebration for fans that drew in over 11,000 attendees last year(2016).

## The Operations Department
Within the organization my position is the Assistant Director of Operations. Kawaii Kon is split into several departments each with their own unique duties and as one of three directors in the Operations department, one of my duties is to ensure that all other departments are on the same page. When the convention is not actively being held I participate in director's meetings where I share, compile, and clarify information relayed between departments.

In addition, the Operations department is also responsible for handling and maintaing the several hundreds of regular staff that help us run the convention during the weekend. To do so, we hold four staff meetings during the year where we explain the duties expected of them, provide information on updated news for the convention, and check in our staff to ensure that our records are maintained properly.

During the convention the Operations department is primarily responsible for running the information desk. Here we recieve questions about the convention and surrounding area. It is important for us to have general knowledge of Honolulu, and every aspect of the convention.

## Assistant Director of Operations
As an assistant director, my duties to my department are quite varied. During meetings, I take notes on what each department has presented and follow up with questions for clarification. If a department or representative is not able to attend a meeting, I reach out to them to find out if they have any updates and relay them to the rest of the directors. During our regular staff meetings I split duties with our department's other assistant director. I am peraonally responsible for briefing our new staff memebers on what is expected of them, and give them generalized information on what they will be doing. From there the meeting will break up into individual departments where I inform our staff members where to go. At the convention I manage our infomation desk.
