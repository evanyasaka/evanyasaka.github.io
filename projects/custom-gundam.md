## Taking Scale Modeling to the Next Level
This is the product of my first foray into "real" modeling and the culmination of months of planning, researching, and building that began in Spring of 2014. I could not be happier with how it turned out despite the fact that I ran out of Summer to really finish the whole project. At the end of 2013 a show featuring the possibilities of Gundam model building aired and I was captivated and motivated to produe work of their quality. Originally, I wanted to do some really crazy custom work like what was being done in the show such as scratch building new armor pieces or weapons but up until this point, I did nothing more than straight box builds with panel lining using a Gundam Marker. In the end I settled on doing something called a kitbash and giving it a custom paint job. A kitbash is taking multiple different model kits and pulling pieces and parts from several different kits and putting them together in one model. Even this however was way out of my comfort zone but I was determined to do justice to my vision and honor the hobby I love to the best of my abilities.

I've been building gunpla almost my entire life. When I was six years old, I got my first kit from, of all people, my hairdresser. (It was a NG Gundam Maxter that I still have somewhere tucked away in a storage locker) That was 1996 -- almost two decades ago. I've been building ever since and although I graduated from twisting pieces out of sprues I have still only barely scratched the surface of the hobby many people enjoy.

This picture was taken way back in February 2014 and it was the first iteration of what would eventually become my proudest modeling achievement yet. It's a pretty simple kitbash that utilized the parts from three differnt kits. My vision through the whole project was to really capture and showcase the one thing that really made the show easily one of my favorite of all time. Beyond the cool fight scenes, the cameos and the excellent custom mobile suits that were showcased, what really sold the series for me was the crossover aspect. It was the first time in animated history that all corners of the Gundam universe were brought together in to a series. I wanted my custom build to have two things. 

1. The System Weapons 5 pieces because they are the coolest things ever.
2. Parts from as many different Gundam universes that I could smash onto it.

This was the second version of the project. It utilized parts from the Crossbone Maoh, the HGUC desert color Nemo, and the Double X and V2.I was playing with the idea of the shields acting like bit systems similar to the Unicorn by attaching to the backpack through the arms of the Skull Weapons pack. In the end, I abandoned the idea because I felt that the backpack just wasn't bulky enough. It was around this time, I decided that the design was projecting towards a heavy armor style unit and I ran with it.

There were several other variations that I put together that ranged from using the 00 Raiser as a base to trying to mash some of the RG RX-78-2 onto the build. In the end this was my final product. Up until this point it was a lot of trial and error just seeing what worked and what didn't. It wasn't until I put this together that I first grinned and said "this is it".

The next challenge was to pick out a color scheme. I wanted something military and something relatively realistic. I tossed around some ideas such as the RGM-79 [G] orange and tan color scheme, the Jesta blues, and combinations of grays and blacks but I ended up sticking to one of my favorite color schemes -- the sand and green ECOAS type colors from the Loto.

WIth the color scheme picked out I decided to dismantle the whole thing to paint piece by piece. While doing research around this point I discovered panel line erasing. I thought about trying the technique with my custom but I decided against it as I didn't have the materials on hand to do so.

This was my first color test using Tamiya spray cans on Krylon white primer. 90% of the model is painted with rattle cans as at the time, I did not have an airbrush.

This was my first time ever painting beyond my initial color testing. I was ultra paranoid about how much primer to put, how close or far my spray can should be, proper technique to spray with, how much paint to use, how long to let things dry, etc.. The process was surprisingly intuitive. I did quite a bit of reasearch before-hand so I somewhat knew what to expect. Trying it in action was a much different beast though so I was glad I did the color test first to get a feel for how it was going to work, and look.

The base colors are all done. Time to begin test assembly.

This was the first time I was speechless through the whole build. Sure it was just the base colors with no topcoat but to know what it looked like before to how it looked now just blew me away. I knew painting a model kit really gives it personality but it wasn't until this point that I really understood how much of a difference it could make.

Accessories are now stripped off, gloss coat was added, panel lining was done and everything is ready for detailing. Detail paint, panel lining, waterslides are all finished. I added the red captain's stripe on the right side with an airbrush by masking off the rest of the arm and going over with a flat red. Recessed areas are filled in with a grey colored paint to show shadows and bring out the different levels of panels.

After everything was finished I put it all back together and couldn't resist immediately putting it in an action pose. This was really an amazing journey for me and a big stride forward in my wieldable techniques. Although I still have a lot more to learn and try, I could not be happier with how a project that started with just a silly idea in my head turned out. I've been building models for almost twenty years now and there is no way I'm stopping after this!
