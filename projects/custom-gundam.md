## Taking Scale Modeling to the Next Level
This is the product of my first foray into "real" modeling and the culmination of months of planning, researching, and building that began in Spring of 2014. I could not be happier with how it turned out despite the fact that I ran out of Summer to really finish the whole project. At the end of 2013 a show featuring the possibilities of Gundam model building aired and I was captivated and motivated to produe work of their quality. Originally, I wanted to do some really crazy custom work like what was being done in the show such as scratch building new armor pieces or weapons but up until this point, I did nothing more than straight box builds with panel lining using a Gundam Marker. In the end I settled on doing something called a kitbash and giving it a custom paint job. A kitbash is taking multiple different model kits and pulling pieces and parts from several different kits and putting them together in one model. Even this however was way out of my comfort zone but I was determined to do justice to my vision and honor the hobby I love to the best of my abilities.

I've been building gunpla almost my entire life. When I was six years old, I got my first kit from, of all people, my hairdresser. (It was a NG Gundam Maxter that I still have somewhere tucked away in a storage locker) That was 1996 -- almost two decades ago. I've been building ever since and although I graduated from twisting pieces out of sprues I have still only barely scratched the surface of the hobby many people enjoy.

This picture was taken way back in February 2014 and it was the first iteration of what would eventually become my proudest modeling achievement yet. It's a pretty simple kitbash that utilized the parts from three differnt kits. My vision through the whole project was to really capture and showcase the one thing that really made the show easily one of my favorite of all time. Beyond the cool fight scenes, the cameos and the excellent custom mobile suits that were showcased, what really sold the series for me was the crossover aspect. It was the first time in animated history that all corners of the Gundam universe were brought together in to a series. I wanted my custom build to have two things. 1. The System Weapons 5 pieces because they are the coolest things ever. 2. Parts from as many different Gundam universes that I could smash onto it.
